A\nphysically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

(CVE-2022-42719)\n\nSönke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to a\nuse-after-free vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use\nthis to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42720)\n\nSönke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel did\nnot properly handle BSSID/SSID lists in some situations. A physically\nproximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite\nloop). (CVE-2022-42721)\n\nSönke Huster discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel\ncontained a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in certain situations.
